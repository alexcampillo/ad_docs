Meteor is a javascript development environment designed for building realtime applications. Meteor apps can deploy easily to web, iOS and android.

##Installing Meteor
First open up your terminal and copy and paste the following command

`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

The install should be seamless but just in case there are any problems, refer to the official meteor documentation.

[Meteor Install](https://www.meteor.com/install)

##Setting up a Project

First create a directory somewhere to store all of your Meteor projects. It doesn't have to be on the desktop, just somewhere convenient for you. 

ex: `cd ~/Desktop && mkdir Meteor`

Then navigate to your folder and create a new Meteor project

`cd ~/Desktop/Meteor`

`meteor create yourprojectname`

Navigate into your new meteor project and type the following command, using your own project's name.

`cd yourprojectname`

`meteor run yourprojectname`

This will get your project up and running on localhost.

##File Structure

When you first create a new Meteor project you are given 3 files

* yourproject.html
* yourproject.css
* yourproject.js

Delete these files. Although there is no defined structure for a Meteor app we want to create some sort of organization, as you'll soon see there will be a lot of files as your app grows.
